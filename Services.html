          caring for critically ill patients. ICUs are also distinguished from general hospital wards by a higher
          staff-to-patient ratio and access to advanced medical resources and equipment that is not routinely available
          elsewhere. Common conditions that are treated within ICUs include acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic
