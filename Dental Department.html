            The specialty of dentistry is one of the branches of human medicine, which is concerned
            with the study of the mouth and face, not just the teeth. The importance of studying human
            medicine lies in the importance of dentistry itself. Teeth are one of the hardest parts of
            the human body, and one of their most important functions is to chew food, especially
            the front teeth. It also has an important role in speech outputs.
            The specialty of dentistry is a surgical medical field concerned with the diagnosis, prevention and
            treatment of diseases or injuries in the teeth, especially the jaws and oral cavity.
            Dentistry has become one of the top fields of study of choice for many students, especially
            after the tremendous technological progress in radiology and the materials used in the
            treatment of diseases, restorations and cosmetic dentistry.
            And dentistry has an ancient history dating back to seven thousand BC. Therefore, the cultural
            and technological development has created a boom in this specialty, which is considered today
            one of the most important medical specialties.
